Abstract
The disequilibrium combination of abundant methane and carbon dioxide has been proposed as a promising
exoplanet biosignature that is readily detectable with upcoming telescopes such as the James Webb Space
Telescope. However, few studies have explored the possibility of nonbiological CH4 and CO2 and related
contextual clues. Here we investigate whether magmatic volcanic outgassing on terrestrial planets can produce
atmospheric CH4 and CO2 with a thermodynamic model. Our model suggests that volcanoes are unlikely to
produce CH4 ﬂuxes comparable to biological ﬂuxes. Improbable cases where volcanoes produce biological
amounts of CH4 also produce ample carbon monoxide. We show, using a photochemical model, that high abiotic
CH4 abundances produced by volcanoes would be accompanied by high CO abundances, which could be a
detectable false-positive diagnostic. Overall, when considering known mechanisms for generating abiotic CH4 on
terrestrial planets, we conclude that observations of atmospheric CH4 with CO2 are difﬁcult to explain without the
presence of biology when the CH4 abundance implies a surface ﬂux comparable to modern Earth’s biological CH4
ﬂux. A small or negligible CO abundance strengthens the CH4+CO2 biosignature because life readily consumes
atmospheric CO, while reducing volcanic gases likely cause CO to build up in a planet’s atmosphere. Furthermore,
the difﬁculty of volcanically generated CH4-rich atmospheres suitable for an origin of life may favor alternatives
such as impact-induced reducing atmospheres.

2000; Kasting & Catling 2003).
Recently, Krissansen-Totton et al. (2018b) proposed a
criterion for methane biosignatures: ﬁnding abundant CH4 in
the presence of CO2 (abbreviated CH4+CO2). This combination is compelling if the CH4 mixing ratio is greater than 0.1%
because it is difﬁcult to explain such an abundance with the
short atmospheric lifetime of CH4 in terrestrial atmospheres
and nonbiological methane sources such as serpentinization
(Krissansen-Totton et al. 2018b). This 0.1% threshold value is
for planets that orbit stars like the Sun and must be adjusted for
different stellar types. For example, planets orbiting M-stars
typically receive less near-UV radiation than planets orbiting
Sun-like stars, resulting in different photochemistry that
promotes the buildup of CH4 (Segura et al. 2005; Grenfell
et al. 2007, 2014; Rugheimer et al. 2015; Rugheimer &
Kaltenegger 2018). Krissansen-Totton et al. (2018b) argued
that the CH4 biosignature is strengthened by a low CO
abundance because volcanoes that produce CH4 should also
likely generate CO. Additionally, living planets might have low
CO because microbes consume CO (Kharecha et al. 2005);
coupled ecosystem-planetary models of the early Earth suggest
atmospheric CO/CH4 ratios declined dramatically with the
emergence of chemoautotrophic ecosystems (Sauterey et al.
2020).
Exploring false positives for methane biosignatures is
timely. Biogenic O2 or O3 detections with upcoming
telescopes, such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST),
will be extremely difﬁcult (Barstow & Irwin 2016; Krissansen-Totton et al. 2018a; Fauchez et al. 2019; Lustig-Yaeger
et al. 2019; Wunderlich et al. 2020), whereas CH4+CO2

1. Introduction
Large telescopes will soon be used to search for biogenic
waste gases in exoplanet atmospheres. Oxygen is the most
extensively studied biosignature gas (Meadows 2017; Meadows
et al. 2018). Although many studies have proposed ways of
identifying scenarios where nonliving processes might mimic life
by producing oxygen (i.e., false positives; Domagal-Goldman
et al. 2014; Tian et al. 2014; Wordsworth & Pierrehumbert 2014;
Harman et al. 2015; Luger & Barnes 2015; Schwieterman et al.
2019), the circumstances are unusual and contextual clues can
distinguish abiotic scenarios (Meadows et al. 2018).
However, even when life is present, oxygen biosignatures
may be uncommon. Oxygenic photosynthesis is a complex
metabolism that only evolved once on Earth (Fischer et al.
2016). Additionally, oxygen was slow to accumulate in the
Earth’s atmosphere (Lyons et al. 2014), and other planets may
have low O2 concentrations for billions of years despite having
oxygenic photosynthetic life if there are large oxygen sinks
(Claire et al. 2006). Accumulation of oxygen may be especially
challenging on planets orbiting M-dwarf stars due to their low
visible photon ﬂux, which potentially limits primary production
(Lehmer et al. 2018).
One alternative to detecting oxygen-rich planets like the
modern Earth is to look for methane on planets like the
Archean Earth. Before the rise of oxygen, methanogenic life
could have sustained a methane-rich atmosphere, which could

biosignatures are more readily detectable. Indeed, an
Archean-Earth-like CH4+CO2 biosignature is potentially
detectable on the planet TRAPPIST-1e, with just 10 transits
(Krissansen-Totton et al. 2018a). Thus, exploration of
potential methane biosignature false positives and their
contextual discriminants is needed.
The literature exploring false positives for methane biosignatures has primarily focused on CH4 generation in
deep-sea serpentinizing hydrothermal vents. Guzmán-Marmolejo et al. (2013) estimated a maximum CH4 surface ﬂux of
0.18 Tmol yr−1 (6.8 ´ 108 molecules cm−2 s-1) from hydrothermal vents for planets with the same mass as Earth.
Additionally, Krissansen-Totton et al. (2018b) used Monte
Carlo simulations to estimate a probability distribution for
maximum abiotic CH4 production from this process. They
suggest that >10 Tmol CH4 yr−1 is highly unlikely. These
estimated maximum ﬂuxes are small compared to modern
Earth’s biological CH4 ﬂux of 30 Tmol yr−1.
However, investigations of abiotic CH4 on Earth suggest that
these estimates of abiotic CH4 from hydrothermal vents are
potentially unrealistically large. Serpentinization reactions involving water and ultramaﬁc oceanic crust generate H2; then,
purportedly, H2 might react with inorganic carbon in hydrothermal systems to generate CH4. Krissansen-Totton et al.
(2018b) and Guzmán-Marmolejo et al. (2013) both estimated
abiotic CH4 ﬂuxes, assuming efﬁcient reactions between H2 and
inorganic carbon. However, laboratory experiments have shown
that, uncatalyzed, this reaction is extremely slow at hydrothermal
vent temperatures and pressures preventing chemical equilibrium
on timescales of at least months (Reeves & Fiebig 2020).
Additionally, various lines of evidence suggest that much of the
CH4 observed in deep-sea hydrothermal vent waters is ultimately
from biology (Reeves & Fiebig 2020). Furthermore, lifeless
planets without silica-secreting organisms should have high
ocean-water SiO2 concentrations, which suppresses the H2 and
therefore abiotic CH4 produced from serpentinization (Tutolo
et al. 2020).
Impacts can likely generate abiotic CH4 (Zahnle et al. 2020),
although impact-generated CH4 is only probable early in a solar
system’s lifetime. The cratering record on the Moon shows that
Earth’s impact ﬂux decreased dramatically by 3.5 Ga (Marchi
et al. 2014). Thus, extra-solar systems that are several billion
years old are probably unlikely to have abiotic CH4 from this
source.
Here we investigate another potential false-positive for the
CH4+CO2 biosignature: magma-sourced volcanic outgassing
(i.e., not metamorphic). Negligible CH4 has been observed in
gases emitted by magmatic volcanoes on Earth (Catling &
Kasting 2017; Reeves & Fiebig 2020), although it has not been
investigated whether substantial CH4 is feasible for volcanoes
in vastly different thermodynamic regimes. We simulate
outgassing speciation for a range of magma temperatures,
outgassing pressures, oxygen fugacities, volatile composition,
and variable partitioning between subaerial and submarine
volcanism. We examine whether volcanoes can produce CH4
ﬂuxes comparable to biological ﬂuxes. Using a photochemical
model, we also investigate the atmospheric composition of
hypothetical planets by reducing volcanic gases to see whether
volcanic CH4 coincides with large atmospheric CO, which
could be a detectable false-positive marker.

2. Methods
2.1. Model for Calculating Volcanic Outgassing Speciation
Below, we describe our model for predicting the gases
produced by an erupting mantle-sourced volcano. We follow
Gaillard & Scaillet (2014) and solve for the gas–gas and gas–
melt equilibrium in a C–O–H system. Our model differs from
Gaillard & Scaillet (2014) because we do not consider nitrogen
or sulfur species. Despite these differences, we obtain similar
results to calculations made in Gaillard & Scaillet (2014). We
have also validated our code against the work of Liggins et al.
(2020) and Ortenzi et al. (2020), which have independently
constructed similar outgassing models. Our Python code is
published as open-source software on the GitHub page https://
github.com/Nicholaswogan/VolcGases.
Figure 1 shows a highly schematic conceptualization of
volcanic degassing typical of low-viscosity magma. Gas
bubbles form in the magma when molecules like H2O and
CO2 are exsolved. Within the gas bubbles, reactions drive the
system to chemical equilibrium. The oxygen fugacity ( fO2 ) of
the gas bubble is controlled by equilibrium with the oxygen
fugacity of the magma (e.g., Kadoya et al. 2020). Gases
bubbles are released from the magma and enter the overlying
atmosphere or ocean.
A mathematical model describes the volatiles in gas bubbles
and magma. The amount of carbon and hydrogen that are
exsolved by the magma into bubbles is governed by the
solubility of CO2 and H2O, which we calculate with the
solubility relations for maﬁc magmas described in IaconoMarziano et al. (2012):
ln (x CO2) = x H2 O d H2 O + a CO2 ln (P CO2) + S1,

(1 )

ln (x H2 O) = a H2 O ln (P H2 O) + S1.

(2 )

Here x CO2 and x H2 O are mol fractions of CO2 and H2O in the
magma, respectfully. Additionally, PCO2 and PH2 O are the partial
pressure of CO2 and H2O in gas bubbles suspended in the
magma. The other terms in Equations (1) and (2) are solubility
parameters with values shown in Table 1, except S1 and S2,
which are further described in Appendix A.1. We use solubility
relations appropriate for maﬁc magmas because rocky planets
and moons in our solar system usually have basaltic crusts,
suggesting that maﬁc magma is common to most terrestrial
bodies.
Volatile mol fractions (e.g., x H2 O ) can be converted to mass
fractions with the formula
x i mi
mi =
(3 )
m magma
Here mi is the mass fraction, mi is the volatile’s molar mass, and
i can be either H2O or CO2. Table 1 gives the units of
each term.
We assume that after the hot gas exsolves from the magma
into bubbles, it achieves thermodynamic equilibrium from the

we have seven unknowns ( x CO2 , x H2 O , PCO2 , PH2 O , PCO, PH2 ,
PCH 4) and only ﬁve equations. To close the system, we add
three more equations and one more unknown. The ﬁrst
equation requires that the partial pressures sum to the total
pressure:

At thermodynamic equilibrium, the ratios of the fugacities of
volatile species (denoted fi) are related to the equilibrium
constant corresponding to each chemical reaction. We assume
that we can replace fugacities with partial pressures (denoted
Pi). This approximation is reasonable for the temperatures and
pressures involved in volcanic outgassing (Holland 1984).

Equations (1), (2), (7)–(12) are a system of eight equations and
eight unknowns ( x CO2 , x H2 O, PCO2 , PH2 O , PCO , PH2 , PCH 4 ,agas).
We solve this system of equations numerically with the Scipy
Python package.
The solution to this system of equilibrium equations
provides an estimate of the amount of each volatile species in
gas bubbles in magma immediately before the gas leaves the
magma. We assume bubbles remain in thermodynamic
equilibrium with the surrounding melt until they are released
into the overlying atmosphere or ocean, and volatile speciation
does not continue to evolve upon release. This does not exactly
reﬂect real degassing. Observed outgassing chemistry suggests
that volcanic gas re-equilibrates to temperatures slightly lower
than the magma as the gas leaves the magma and is no longer
chemically buffered by it (Oppenheimer et al. 2018; Moussallam et al. 2019; Kadoya et al. 2020). We do not capture this
complexity in the main text, although in Appendix A.4 we

investigate the closed system re-equilibration of volcanic gases
and show that this process does not change our conclusions.
Once the unknowns are solved for, they can be used to
calculate the gas production (i.e., the moles of gas produced per
kilogram of magma erupted):

Here qi is the gas production of species i in mol gas kg−1
magma. Calculating qi is useful because it is related to the ﬂux
Fi of gas i to the atmosphere by the magma production rate:
Fi = qi Q m.

(14)

Here Qm is the magma production rate in kg magma yr−1 and
Fi is in mol yr−1.
Several authors have shown that degassing can be affected
by graphite saturation of magma (Hirschmann & Withers 2008)
or by the solubility of CO, CH4, and H2 in magma (Hirschmann
et al. 2012; Ardia et al. 2013; Wetzel et al. 2013). The gas
speciation model described previously does not account for
these processes. However, in Appendix A.3, we introduce a
more complex model that accounts for graphite saturation and
CO, CH4, and H2 solubility, and show that this model produces
very similar results to the simpliﬁed model described here.

2.2. Monte Carlo Simulations
We investigate volcanic false positives to the CH4+CO2
biosignature on two types of worlds: an Earth-like world with
subaerial and submarine outgassing (Figure 2) and an ocean
world with only submarine outgassing. For each type of planet,
we search for false-positive scenarios by calculating volcanic
outgassing speciation with a wide range of input parameters.
To explore volcanism on Earth-like planets, we calculate
outgassing speciation 10,000 times. For each calculation,
we sample either uniform or log10-uniform distributions
(see Table 2) of 10 parameters: Tsubmarine, Psubmarine,

partial pressure of species i in subaerial and submarine

Figure 3. Results of the Monte Carlo simulation described in Section 2.2. (a) and (b) show normalized count as a function of log (CH 4 CO) and log (CO2 CO) for an
ocean world and Earth-like world, respectively. The white dotted lines indicate where CH4/CO=1 and CO2/CO=1. For almost all calculated gas speciations, CO2
and CO are much more abundant than CH4.

Figures 4(a) and (b) show CH4 production from the Monte
Carlo simulations in terms of mol CH4 kg−1 magma. To give a
sense of the gas ﬂuxes implied by these CH4 productions, we
multiply the distributions in Figures 4(a) and (b) by the magma
production rate of modern Earth of 9×1013 kg yr−1 (Crisp
1984), which gives the gas ﬂuxes shown in Figures 4(c) and
(d), respectively. About 0.1% of calculations predict more than
10 Tmol CH4 yr−1 for both Earth-like worlds and ocean
worlds. This small fraction suggests that for modern Earth
magma production rates, volcanoes are unlikely to produce
CH4 ﬂuxes comparable to modern Earth’s biological ﬂux of
30 Tmol yr−1 (Hauglustaine et al. 2007).
Magma production rates larger than modern Earth’s increase
the probability that volcanic ﬂuxes of CH4 become comparable
to biological CH4 ﬂuxes. For example, the early Archean Earth
could have had magma production rates up to about 25 times
modern Earth’s (Sleep & Zahnle 2001). Such a magma
production rate would shift the distributions in Figures 4(c)
and (d) to larger values by a factor of 25 (or in log10-space, by a
factor of 1.4). In this case, ∼2% of calculations (for either
Earth-like world or ocean world) would predict more than 10
Tmol CH4 yr−1.
Crucially, large CH4 ﬂuxes should almost always coincide
with even larger CO ﬂuxes (horizontal axis in Figure 3).
Therefore, the unlikely cases where volcanoes mimic biological
CH4 ﬂuxes can be identiﬁed by detecting abundant CO in a
planet’s atmosphere. We further investigate CO as a CH4+CO2
biosignature discriminant using a photochemical model in the
following section.

To investigate volcanism on an ocean world, we also calculate
outgassing speciation 10,000 times. For each calculation, we
sample either uniform or log10-uniform distributions of inputs
tot
Tsubmarine , Psubmarine , m CO
, m Htot2 O, submarine , and fO2 , with
2, submarine
ranges deﬁned and justiﬁed in Table 2.
2.3. Photochemical Modeling: Uninhabited Anoxic Ocean
World with Reducing Volcanic Gases
We further investigate the CH4+CO2 biosignature by
modeling the atmospheric composition of hypothetical uninhabited ocean worlds with reducing volcanic gases. We consider
planets orbiting the Sun and a late M star—the latter because
planets orbiting M-dwarfs are the most feasible targets for nearterm telescopes like JWST (Barstow & Irwin 2016). Additionally, we simulate ocean worlds because ocean-bottom degassing
is most thermodynamically prone to produce CH4, as revealed by
our Monte Carlo simulations and previous studies (French 1966;
Kasting & Brown 1998; see Section 4.1.1 for further discussion).
To simulate atmospheres on uninhabited planets, we use the
1-D photochemical model contained within the open-source
software package Atmos. Atmos is derived from a model
originally developed by the Kasting group (Pavlov et al. 2001),
and versions of this code have been used to simulate the
Archean and Proterozoic Earth atmosphere (Zahnle et al.
2006), Mars (Zahnle et al. 2008; Smith et al. 2014; Sholes et al.
2019), and exoplanet atmospheres (Harman et al. 2015;
Schwieterman et al. 2019).

3.2. Photochemical Modeling: Uninhabited Anoxic Ocean
World with Reducing Volcanic Gases

3.1. Monte Carlo Simulations
Figure 3 shows joint distributions of gas ratios CH4/CO and
CO2/CO from the Monte Carlo simulation described in
Section 2.2. These results suggest that for most combinations
of parameters, volcanoes are most likely to produce more CO2
than CO, and negligible CH4, which is the case for the modern
Earth (Catling & Kasting 2017). About 7% and 2% of
calculations produce more CH4 than CO for ocean worlds and
Earth-like worlds, respectfully. In the vast majority of cases,
either CO or CO2 is the dominant carbon-bearing species.

We use the Atmos photochemical model to simulate the

fayalite-magnetite-quartz buffer, which is a synthetic reference fO2
value at ﬁxed temperature-pressure conditions. Additionally,
we assume that the magma contains 0.1 wt% CO2 and 1 wt%
H2O. Our assumed H2O concentration is comparable to those
observed in submarine hot-spot magmas (0.2 to 1.5 wt%;
Wallace et al. 2015); however, the CO2 concentration we
assume is slightly lower (Anderson & Poland 2017). Given
these inputs, our speciation model (Section 2.1) predicts gas
production from erupted magma of qH2 = 4.36 ´ 10-2 mol
gas/kg magma, qCO = 1.29 ´ 10-2 mol gas/kg magma, and
qCH 4 = 7.39 ´ 10-3 mol gas/kg magma.
The magnitude of gas ﬂuxes to the atmosphere resulting
from chemically reducing volcanism depends on the magma
production rate (Equation (14)). We consider magma production rates between about 10−3 and 102 Earth’s modern magma
production rate of 9×1013 kg magma yr−1 (Crisp 1984).
For each magma production rate, we calculate the outgassing
ﬂux of CH4, H2, and CO and set these ﬂuxes as lower boundary
conditions to the Atmos photochemical model. (The outgassing
model also gives CO2 and H2O ﬂuxes, but we do not use them
in our photochemical modeling.) Atmos only allows ﬁxed CO2
mixing ratios and not CO2 ﬂuxes, so we consider cases with
low and high CO2 (100 ppm and 10%). Additionally, we set the
deposition velocity of CO to 10−8 cm s−2 to reﬂect the abiotic
uptake of CO by the ocean (Kharecha et al. 2005). All other

boundary conditions are speciﬁed in Appendix B. Given
volcanic outgassing ﬂuxes and other boundary conditions,
Atmos calculates the mixing ratios of all species when the
atmosphere is at photochemical equilibrium.
Figure 5 shows the photochemical modeling results of
reducing volcanic gases on an uninhabited Earth-sized ocean
world orbiting the Sun. Figure 5(a) assumes that the
atmosphere has 100 ppmv CO2, while Figure 5(b) assumes
that atmospheric CO2 is 10%. Carbon monoxide and methane
are more abundant in the model with more CO2 because CO2
shields the lower atmosphere from hydoxyl (OH) production
from water photolysis. In anoxic atmospheres, OH is a
signiﬁcant sink for both CO and CH4 through the reactions
CO2 + OH  CO2 + H and CH 4 + OH  CH3 + H2 O.
OH is generated primarily from H2O photolysis
(H2 O + hn [l < 200 nm]  OH + H ), but CO2 shields
H2O from photolysis in model runs with 10% CO2, thus
limiting the CH4 and CO destruction from OH. Also, CH4 is
more abundant in atmospheres with more CO2 because CO2
shields CH4 from direct photolysis in cases when CO2 is >200
times as abundant as CH4. This factor of ∼200 comes from
comparing Lyα (λ=121.6 nm) CO2 and CH4 cross sections.
Lyα is the portion of the UV spectrum primarily responsible
for photolyzing CH4.
Figure 5 suggests that reducing volcanic gases on an ocean
world orbiting a Sun-like star will only mimic biological CH4

abundances are only mimicked by volcanoes for magma production rates >10 times modern Earth’s. Such false-positive cases can be distinguished from biology
because the CO abundance exceeds the CH4 abundance, which would likely not be the case for an inhabited planet.

ﬂuxes and abundances for large magma production rates.
Volcanism can generate Earth’s modern biological CH4 ﬂux
when the magma production rate is ∼50 times modern Earth’s
(Figure 5). In this case, the photochemical model predicts an
atmospheric CH4 abundance between 0.01% and 0.3%,
depending on the CO2 mixing ratio. Such CH4 abundances
are similar to the 0.01% to 1% expected in the early Archean
Earth atmosphere (Catling & Zahnle 2020). In contrast, magma
production rates comparable to the modern Earth’s result in a
CH4 ﬂux of 2.4 ´ 109 molecules cm−2 s−1 (0.64 Tmol yr−1)
and CH4 abundances <30 ppm , which are likely to be
considered abiotic levels in an anoxic atmosphere.
Figure 6 shows the CO and CH4 mixing ratios on an Earthsized ocean world with reducing volcanic gases orbiting a cold
M star. CO and CH4 are more abundant on the ocean world
orbiting the M star compared to the ocean world orbiting a Sunlike star (Figure 5). This is because M8V stars have a low ﬂux of

near-ultraviolet radiation compared to Sun-like stars. The low
near-ultraviolet ﬂux reduces OH produce from H2O photolysis,
thus allowing for relatively high CO and CH4 concentrations.
One consequence of M-dwarf photochemistry is a higher
likelihood of Archean Earth-like CH4 abundances on uninhabited planets with reducing gases from volcanism. Figure 6
shows that modern Earth magma production rates can result in
CH4 abundances up to 0.01%, which is comparable to what is
expected in the Archean atmosphere.
Potential CH4 biosignature false positives from reducing
volcanic gases might be discriminated from inhabited worlds
using observations of CO. For planets orbiting Sun-like stars
(Figure 5) or M stars (Figure 6), the CO abundance is higher
than the CH4 abundance in every case that is a potential
outgassing false-positive. Some authors have argued that a large
CO abundance is unlikely on an inhabited planet, because
atmospheric CO should be readily consumed by biology

(Krissansen-Totton et al. 2018a). Conversely, Schwieterman
et al. (2019) has demonstrated hypothetical cases where large CO
can coincide with biology in an anoxic atmosphere. We further
discuss CO as a false-positive discriminant in Section 4.2.

Figure 7(a) shows modeled gas speciation for highly
reducing volcanism ( fO2 = FMQ-4) as a function of pressure.
For small pressures (<100 bar), CH4 increases with increasing
pressure and then asymptotes for pressures >100 bar.
CH4 asymptotes because of the high solubility of water in
magma at high pressure. High pressures dissolve a large fraction
of the total available hydrogen as H2O into the magma, which is
shown in Figure 7(b). Dissolving a large amount of H2O into the
magma limits the amount of hydrogen available in the gas phase
for making H-bearing species, like CH4, H2O, and H2.
In summary, high pressure is in some ways thermodynamically
favorable for making methane because PCH 4 PCO2 µ PH22 O , but it
is also unfavorable because high pressure dissolves a large
fraction of the available hydrogen in the magma as H2O. Limited
amounts of hydrogen in gas bubbles result in small amounts of
CH4 produced.
Kasting & Brown (1998) used Equation (16) to argue that
∼1% of the carbon outgassed by submarine volcanoes should
be CH4 for magma with fO2 = FMQ . They assumed that
PH2 O » P , the total pressure. This assumption is valid for
oxidized subaerial volcanoes because ∼90% of the gas
exsolved by Earth’s subaerial volcanoes is H2O (Catling &
Kasting 2017, p. 203). However, PH2 O < P for submarine
volcanoes because of the high-water solubility in magma at
high pressure. Our outgassing model, which accounts for
water’s solubility in magma, produces negligible methane.
Li & Lee (2004) also predict abundant CH4 produced by
subaerial and submarine volcanoes (their Figure 5). However,
they calculated equilibrium constants in units of bars and then
used units of Pascals for equilibrium chemistry calculations. The
result was that they calculated speciation for pressures a factor
10,000 times greater than reported. For example, we were able to
reproduce their subaerial outgassing case (their Figure 5(a)) by
assuming P=10,000 bar and not the P=1 bar total pressure
they intended. Additionally, like Kasting & Brown (1998), they
did not account for the high solubility of H2O in magma at high
pressure. Their methods assume the total hydrogen outgassed for
submarine volcanoes is the same as the total hydrogen outgassed
by subaerial volcanoes. This should not be the case, because at

4. Discussion
4.1. The Reasons Why Volcanoes Produce Little CH4
Our modeling results show that for modern Earth magma
production rates, volcanic ﬂuxes of reducing gases are unlikely
to produce more than 1 Tmol CH4 yr−1, even in an extreme case
(Figure 4). This ﬂux is relatively small compared to the ﬂux of
other volcanic gases on modern Earth. For example, Earth’s
modern volcanoes produce about 7.5 Tmol CO2 yr−1 and 95
Tmol H2O yr−1 (Catling & Kasting 2017, p. 203). There are
three main reasons why the outgassing model predicts little CH4,
which we explore further in the following discussion.
4.1.1. Volcanoes Produce Little CH4 because of Water Solubility in
Magma

One reason for small CH4 outgassing is the high solubility of
water in magma at high pressures. Consider Equation (9),
which can be re-arranged as follows:
K3 PH22 O
P CH 4
.
=
P CO2
f O22

(16)

The ratio PCH 4 PCO2 in a gas bubble in magma is directly
proportional to PH22 O within that bubble. Generally speaking,
PH2 O increases as the total pressure of degassing increases
because all partial pressures must sum to the total pressure
(Equation (10)). For example, subaerial degassing at ∼1 bar
will have a relatively small PH2 O and thus a small PCH 4 PCO2
ratio. On the other hand, submarine degassing at ∼400 bar
should have a larger H2O partial pressure and thus a larger
PCH 4 PCO2 ratio. Here the equilibrium constant and oxygen
fugacity have extremely weak pressure dependencies (i.e., they
are effectively constant as degassing pressure changes).

modern Earth because the Earth’s mantle was hotter in the distant
past (Sleep & Zahnle 2001). The hotter Archean mantle resulted
in the eruption of ∼1800 K komatiite magmas (Huppert et al.
1984) or possibly only ∼1600 K (McKenzie 2020). Such hot
magma degassing is unfavorable for methane (Figure 8).

high pressure water dissolves in magma and is unavailable for
making H-bearing gas species (Figure 7(b)).
The pressure dependence of volcanic outgassing has implications for planetary atmospheres generally (Gaillard & Scaillet 2014). Thin atmospheres will allow substantial degassing of
both carbon and hydrogen bearing species. However, planets with
thick atmospheres or large global oceans will have volcanic
degassing dominated by CO2 and CO, and almost no hydrogen
bearing species. The overburden pressure where C-bearing
species dominate depends primarily on the un-degassed concentrations of H2O and CO2 in the magma. In Figure 7, CO2 and CO
overwhelm H-bearing species at ∼1000 bar for initial volatile

volatiles (m CO

species eclipse H-bearing species at ∼1 bar.

4.1.3. Volcanoes Produce Little CH4 because Very Low Oxygen
Fugacity Is Required

The ﬁnal reason why volcanic CH4 is unlikely on terrestrial
planets is because very low fO2 is required to make abundant
methane. Figure 9 shows gas speciation as a function of oxygen
fugacity for submarine volcanism. For these assumed inputs,
methane is a substantial fraction of outgassed species for fO2 <
FMQ-3, and at FMQ-5 (roughly equivalent to the quartz-fayaliteiron buffer), half the carbon is converted to CH4, while the other
half is CO. Most degassing on Earth occurs at approximately
fO2 = FMQ (Catling & Kasting 2017, p. 208), but magma spans
FMQ-4 to FMQ+5 (Stamper et al. 2014). Additionally, the
oxygen fugacity of Martian meteorites ranges between FMQ and
FMQ-3.7 (Catling & Kasting 2017, p. 363). Therefore, the fO2 <
FMQ-3 required for plentiful CH4 outgassing is at the extremes
of the oxygen fugacities observed for Earth and Mars.
Astronomical observations and geochemical experiments
suggest Earth-sized planets should generally have relatively
oxidized magmas. Doyle et al. (2019) spectroscopically measured
the oxygen fugacity of material polluting the surface of several
white dwarfs. Their observations suggest that rocky exoplanets
are likely to have similar oxygen fugacities to Earth and Mars.
Additionally, high pressure experiments suggest that the upper
mantles of Earth-sized planets should self-oxidize by iron oxide
disproportionation to roughly FMQ during the magma-ocean
phase, early in a planet’s life (Armstrong et al. 2019).

4.1.2. Volcanoes Produce Little CH4 because Magma Is Hot

Relatively little CH4 is produced by volcanoes because CH4 is
generally not thermodynamically favorable at typical magma
degassing temperatures. Figure 8 shows gas speciation as a
function of temperature for a submarine outgassing case. For
these chosen inputs, CH4 is the dominant carbon-bearing species
for T < 1200 K. Mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB) are about 2/3
of total magma produced on Earth (Crisp 1984). MORB magma
erupts at temperatures between 1473 and 1650 K (Scheidegger 1973) and are thus in a temperature regime where CH4 is
unfavorable, even from more reducing volcanism.
On the other hand, magma from arc volcanoes is generally
much colder than MORB magma. Moussallam et al. (2019)
report magma temperatures for many arc volcanoes (their Table
S3), the coldest of which are 1123 K. Thus, it does seem
possible for magma to be cold enough for CH4 to be the
dominant carbon-bearing outgassed species from an extremely
reducing volcano with fO2 = FMQ-4.
Recall that large magma production rates (∼30x modern) are
required for volcanoes to produce CH4 ﬂuxes compared to
biological ones (Figure 5). It seems unlikely that planets with
large magma production rates will have magma temperatures
cold enough to produce plentiful CH4. For example, the Archean
Earth may have had a larger magma production rate than the

CO-consuming life evolved very early on Earth (Adam et al.
2018) and is a relatively simple metabolism. Therefore, it seems
possible that life on other planets will evolve to consume CO.
Planets with atmospheric CH4+CO2 produced by life might also
have relatively small amounts of atmospheric CO because of CO

also been used to synthesize amino acids (Miller & Urey 1959;
Sutherland 2016).
The known natural source of nitriles is photochemistry in a
chemically reducing atmosphere containing H2, CH4 and N2 or
perhaps NH3. For example, Titan’s photochemistry produces
all the aforementioned nitriles (Strobel et al. 2009). Importantly, to make the simplest nitrile, HCN, requires abundant
CH4 because HCN is formed from photochemical products of
CH4 and nitrogen (Zahnle 1986; Tian et al. 2011).
Our results show that volcanic gases generally are unlikely to
cause high atmospheric CH4 abundances in prebiotic atmospheres. Consequently, the results lend credence to alternative
proposals for creating early CH4-rich, reducing atmospheres,
such as impacts (Zahnle et al. 2020). Impacts can create a
reducing atmosphere when reactions between iron-rich impact
ejecta and shock-heated water vapor from an ocean generate
copious H2, CH4, and NH3. Subsequent photochemistry would
generate HCN and other prebiotic nitriles over thousands to
millions of years (Zahnle et al. 2020).

consumers. Consequentially, the presence of abundant CO along
with CH4 can discriminate abiotic situations.
Monte Carlo simulations show that volcanoes should almost
always produce more CO than CH4 (Figure 3). Additionally,
photochemical modeling (Figures 5 and 6) suggests that CO
should build up in the atmospheres of uninhabited planets with
reducing submarine volcanic gases. Thus atmospheric CO2+CH4
produced by volcanoes is likely accompanied by a large CO
concentration. This is distinct from an inhabited world, which can
have lower CO concentrations due to CO-consuming life.
However, the mere presence of large atmospheric CO is not
a deﬁnitive sign of an uninhabited planet with reducing
volcanic gases (Schwieterman et al. 2019). This is because
there are limits to how quickly gases can be transported from
the atmosphere into the ocean where they can be consumed by
life (Kharecha et al. 2005). For example, consider a planet with
a very large volcanic CO ﬂux (e.g., 100x modern). CO could
build up in this planet’s atmosphere even if CO consumers
were present in an ocean because CO transport from the
atmosphere to the ocean would not be sufﬁcient to maintain
low atmospheric CO.
In summary, the CH4+CO2 biosignature is most compelling
when the CO abundance is low or negligible because a lack of
CO potentially implies the presence of CO-consuming biology.
In comparison, atmospheric CH4+CO2 and large CO is
ambiguous, and can either be explained by reducing volcanic
gases or by an inhabited world that is unable to sequester
atmospheric CO.
JWST might be able to put a tentative upper limit on
atmospheric CO. Krissansen-Totton et al. (2018a) simulated
JWST retrievals of TRAPPIST-1e with an atmospheric
composition similar to the Archean Earth containing 10 ppbv
CO. Their synthetic retrieval suggested CO was below 652
ppmv with 90% conﬁdence after 10 transits. CO constraints
could be improved by co-adding more transits and positive CO
detections may also be possible with JWST (Wunderlich et al.
2020).
However, even if observational CO constraints are poor, it may
still be possible to say something about the abiotic or biotic origin
of atmospheric CH4. Reducing gases from volcanism is unlikely
to mimic the modern biological CH4 ﬂux of 30 Tmol yr−1
(Section 4.1). Additionally, serpentinization is unlikely to produce
30 Tmol CH4 yr−1, and impact-generated CH4 might be
distinguished with system age (Krissansen-Totton et al. 2018b).
Therefore, JWST observations of atmospheric CH4+CO2 would
be challenging to explain without the presence of biology
regardless of atmospheric CO, as long as the CH4 abundance
implies a surface ﬂux similar to the modern Earthʼs.

5. Conclusions
Our modeling of volcanic outgassing speciation suggests that
chemically reducing volcanism on terrestrial planets is unlikely
to mimic biological CH4 ﬂuxes. The improbable cases where
volcanoes do produce biological CH4 ﬂuxes also often produce
CO. Volcanoes are not prone to produce CH4 for several reasons.
First, the high solubility of H2O in magma limits the amount of
total hydrogen outgassed, thus preventing the production of
H-bearing molecules like CH4. Second, CH4 outgassing requires
relatively low magma temperatures compared to the majority of
magma erupted on Earth. Finally, CH4 outgassing requires a very
low magma oxygen fugacity, unlike that of most terrestrial
planets inferred from astronomical data (Doyle et al. 2019).
We use a photochemical model to calculate the atmospheric
composition of planets with volcanoes that produce CH4. We
ﬁnd that atmospheric CH4 should coincide with abundant CO.
On the other hand, biogenic CH4 can coincide with a low CO
abundance if CO-consuming microbial life is present.
Therefore, the CH4–CO2 biosignature is most compelling
when little or no atmospheric CO is detected. Atmospheric
CH4-CO2 and large CO is ambiguous and can be explained by
an uninhabited planet with highly reducing volcanic gases, or
an inhabited planet where biology is unable to sequester
atmospheric CO (Schwieterman et al. 2019).
However, observations of CO are not required to make
conclusions about the abiotic or biotic origin of observed
atmospheric CH4. Atmospheric CH4 and CO2 alone would have
a reasonable probability of being biological if the observed CH4
abundance implies a surface ﬂux similar to modern Earth’s
biological CH4 ﬂux (30 Tmol yr−1). Such a large CH4 ﬂux is
difﬁcult to explain with reducing volcanic gases or other abiotic
processes that generate CH4, such as serpentinization.
These conclusions should be taken with caution because they
are based on what is understood about processes occurring on
the Earth and our Solar System, which may be a very sparse
sampling of what is possible.

4.3. CH4 Levels and Implications for the Origin on Life
Much current origin of life research revolves around the
“RNA world” hypothesis (Gilbert 1986; Joyce & Szostak 2018;
Sasselov et al. 2020). This hypothesis proposes an interval of time
when primitive life consisted of self-replicating, evolving RNA
molecules, which, at some point, were encapsulated in cells. On a
rocky world, “RNA world” requires that RNA is synthesized from
early raw materials. Laboratory experiments that have successfully
synthesized nucleobases, which are building blocks of RNA,
require the following nitriles: hydrogen cyanide (HCN), cyanoacetylene (HCCCN), and cyanogen (NCCN; Sutherland 2016;
Ritson et al. 2018; Benner et al. 2019). In addition, nitriles have

Appendix A
Details of Outgassing Speciation Model

The following is a derivation for the atom conservation
equation for carbon used in our outgassing model
(Equation (11)). The derivation for the atom conservation
equation for hydrogen follows the exact same procedure, so we
do not include it.
Consider some volume of magma with gas bubbles in it that
contains a total number of moles gtot . The total moles is the sum
of the moles of magma (gmagma ), and the moles of gas in
bubbles suspended in that magma (ggas):

A.1. Solubility Constants for H2O and CO2
Our outgassing model uses solubility equations for H2O and
CO2 in maﬁc magmas from Iacono-Marziano et al. (2012;
Equations (1) and (2)). The parameters S1 and S2 in the solubility
equations depend on the chemical make-up of the magma. We
found that different maﬁc magma compositions did not
signiﬁcantly affect the outputs of our outgassing speciation
model (Section 2.1); therefore, for the purposes of calculating
melt solubility, we ﬁxed the chemical make-up of the magma to
the magma erupting at Mount Etna, Italy, reported by IaconoMarziano et al. (2012). This reduced the complexity of the model
without sacriﬁcing any signiﬁcant amount of accuracy.
Table 3 shows the chemical make-up of the magma at Mount
Etna, and Table 4 shows several solubility constants from
Iacono-Marziano et al. (2012). Together, these values deﬁne
the solubility parameters S1 and S1:

gtot = ggas + gmagma.

Within this same volume of magma, the total moles of carbon
(g Ctot ) is equal to the moles of carbon in the gas phase (g gas

the activity of carbon using Equation (A13). If a C < 1, then we
assume the melt is not graphite saturated and that the calculation is
valid. If a C > 1, then we assume graphite is saturated and
recalculate outgassing speciation by replacing the carbon
conservation equation (Equation (11)), with the graphite saturation
equation with a C = 1 (Equations (A13)). Here we are considering
graphite saturation in the magma just before degassing occurs. Our
treatment is different from, for example, the methods of Ortenzi
et al. (2020) because they are accounting for graphite saturation
much deeper in a planet during partial melting of the mantle.
Figure 10 is identical to Figure 3, except Figure 10 accounts
for graphite saturation. Graphite saturation appears to have a
small effect on the results; therefore, it is justiﬁed to ignore it.
To incorporate the solubility of H2, CH4, and CO into our
model, we add the following solubility relationships to or
system of original outgassing equations (Section 2.1):

Magma sometimes freezes deep in the Earth as a glass before it
releases any volatiles. Measurements of volatiles like CO2 in
such glasses are reported in terms of mass fractions (Wallace
et al. 2015). To stay consistent with these unit conventions, we
indicate the total carbon in un-degassed magma as a mass
tot
fraction of CO2 (m CO2
). We can convert the mass fraction to a

Here pressure-dependent equilibrium constants K5, K6, and

and Wetzel et al. (2013), respectively. For Equation (A16),
we take the activity of iron to be aFe = 0.6, based on the
experiments in Wetzel et al. (2013). Also, we only include
the Equation (A16) when fO2 < IW-0.55 (IW is the ironwustite mineral buffer) because Wetzel et al. (2013) only
observed CO dissolved in magma for these low oxygen
fugacities.
We also alter the carbon and hydrogen atom conservation
equations to accommodate for new molecules in the melt.

A.3. Graphite Saturation and the Solubility of CO, CH4, and H2
m Htot2 O m magma

Several studies have shown that degassing can be affected by
graphite saturation of magma (Hirschmann & Withers 2008) or
by the solubility of CO, CH4, and H2 in magma (Hirschmann
et al. 2012; Ardia et al. 2013; Wetzel et al. 2013). Our model
for outgassing speciation used throughout the main text does
not account for these complications. Here we show that our
assumption is valid because it does not signiﬁcantly change our
results.
Consider the following equilibrium:

Here xi is the mol fraction of species i in the melt.
Figure 11 is identical to Figure 3, except Figure 11 accounts
for H2, CH4, and CO solubility in magma. The solubility of
these three molecules has a small effect on the results; therefore
they can be ignored.

A.4. Closed System Cooling and Chemical Kinetics

(A13)

Our model for volcanic outgassing is a thermodynamic
equilibrium model. We assume that during magma eruptions,
gas bubbles chemically and thermally equilibrate with magma,
and then they are released to the atmosphere unaltered
(Figure 1). This does not exactly reﬂect real degassing.
In reality, the chemical composition of gas bubbles changes
as bubbles leave the magma and enter the atmosphere

Here K9 is the equilibrium constant given by
exp (47457 T + 0.136), and aC is the activity of carbon. To
incorporate graphite saturation into our model, we ﬁrst calculate
outgassing speciation using the model described in the main text
(Section 2.1). Next, we check for graphite saturate by calculating

Graphite saturation has a small effect on the results.

Figure 11. Identical to Figure 3, except here we account for the solubility of H2, CH4, and CO in the melt. As in Figure 3, (a) is for ocean worlds and (b) is for Earthlike worlds. H2, CH4, and CO solubility have a small effect on the results.

(Moussallam et al. 2019; Kadoya et al. 2020). As a bubble
leaves magma, it cools down and new chemical equilibria are
preferred. When a gas bubble ﬁrst begins cooling, it is still very
hot, so chemical reactions keep the bubble near chemical
equilibrium. Once the bubble is cold enough, chemical
reactions slow, and ultimately cease, quenching or freezing
the chemical composition of the gas bubble. Therefore, the
cooling process alters the chemistry of the gas.
Gas re-equilibration to lower temperatures explains the
observed chemistry of volcanic gases globally (Moussallam
et al. 2019), and Oppenheimer et al. (2018) provides a speciﬁc
example of this phenomenon at in the Kilauea volcano in
Hawaii. During eruptions at Kilauea, gas bubbles in the magma
would rise to the surface. As the bubbles rose in the magma,
they adiabatically expanded, which cooled the gas below the
temperature of the magma. Chemical reactions during adiabatic
expansion changed the chemical make-up of the bubble.
For the purposes of understanding potential CH4 biosignature false positives from volcanoes, we need to know if bubble

cooling might generate a substantial amount of CH4. Here we
ﬁrst consider the kinetics of methane generation and show that
reactions are likely too slow to generate substantial CH4 during
gas cooling. Next, we show that our Monte Carlo simulation
results (Figure 4) remain qualitatively unchanged, even if our
kinetics calculations are wrong, and CH4 can be generated
during gas cooling.
CO or CO2 is converted to CH4 through either of the net
reactions (Schaefer & Fegley 2010):
CO + 3H2 « CH 4 + H2 O,

(A19)

CO2 + 4H2 « CH 4 + 2H2 O.

(A20)

The rate-limiting step to either CO or CO2 conversion to CH4 is
debated in the literature (Zahnle & Marley 2014), but the
following are two solid candidates and their corresponding rate
constants:

Figure 13. The blue histograms in (a) and (b) are identical to Figures 4(c) and (d), and orange histograms are identical Monte Carlo simulations, except they account

magma production rate.

Here τ is the chemical lifetime in seconds, and Ni is the number
density of species i in molecules cm−3.
Figure 12 shows timescales of CH4 generation
(Equations (A25)–(A28)) during the closed system cooling of
submarine volcanic gas. To determine gas chemistry just before a
bubble is released from magma, we use our speciation model
(Section 2.1). At 1473 K, we calculate gas speciation assuming
tot
P=400 bar, fO2 = FMQ-4, m CO
= 0.1%, and m Htot2 O = 0.5%.

We then calculate new chemical equilibrium as the gas cools,
assuming it is a closed system (i.e., we assume the gas is

thermally and chemically decoupled from the magma;
Figure 12(a)). Figure 12(b) shows the corresponding timescale of
CH4 generation (Equations (A25)–(A28)) at each temperature.
The quench temperature (i.e., the temperature where outgassing chemistry is frozen-in due to slow kinetics) of CH4
depends on the cooling timescale of volcanic gases (not shown
in Figure 12). CH4 should quench where the cooling timescale
is about the same as the timescale of CH4 generation. After
gases are released from a submarine volcano, we suspect they
cool from magma temperatures to ocean temperatures on the
order of seconds. If this is the case, then the CH4 quench
temperature is probably >1400 K. This would result in a
negligible increase in the CH4 content of the gas (Figure 12(a)).
Suppose that the CH4 quench temperature was instead
1000 K. In this case, the CH4 content of the gas would be
increased by about a factor of ﬁve (Figure 12(a)). There are two
ways that a ∼1000 K CH4 quench is possible. First, gas cooling
could occur on timescales of months rather than seconds.
According to Figure 12(b), month-long gas cooling should
quench CH4 by 1000 K. Second, catalysts could dramatically
speed up the reactions creating CH4, which might allow for
quench temperatures near 1000 K for even gas cooling
timescales of seconds. In the following two paragraphs, we
show that either of these scenarios would not signiﬁcantly
change our results.
To demonstrate that re-equilibration of gases to feasible
lower temperatures does not change our conclusions, assuming
low CH4 quench temperatures can be achieved, we perform
another Monte Carlo simulation identical to the one described
in Section 2.2, except we account for closed system cooling of
volcanic gases. In the Monte Carlo simulation, we ﬁrst
calculate gas composition using our outgassing model
(Section 2.1); then we re-equilibrate this gas mixture to the
uniformly sampled gas equilibrium temperature between 800
and 1500 K. This range of gas equilibrium temperatures is the
range observed in Earth’s volcanic gases (Moussallam et al.
2019). In cases where the randomly drawn gas equilibrium
temperature is higher than the magma temperature, we assume
no closed system cooling occurs.
Figure 13 is identical to Figures 4(c) and (d), except
Figure 13 accounts for closed system cooling of gases. Closed
system cooling allows more CH4 production on average, but
still only 0.3% and 0.1% of calculations for ocean worlds or
earth-like worlds, respectively, produce more than 10 Tmol
CH4 yr−1. The probability of volcanic CH4 ﬂuxes being
comparable to modern Earth’s biological ﬂux (30 Tmol yr−1)
is still low.
In summary, changes in gas chemistry during cooling might
cause our speciation model to under-predict the CH4 produced
by an amount that does not change our conclusions
signiﬁcantly. Further consideration of the kinetics of CH4
generation in volcanic gases is beyond the scope of this paper.

Claire et al. (2012), although our results are not sensitive to the
age of the Sun. For planets orbiting an M8V star, we use
estimates of TRAPPIST-1ʼs spectrum derived by Lincowski
et al. (2018), scaled so that the solar constant of the planet is
0.822 relative to modern Earth’s. We use this solar constant
because it places the simulated planet at the same relative
distance from the inner edge of the habitable zone as Earth
today (Kopparapu et al. 2013).
