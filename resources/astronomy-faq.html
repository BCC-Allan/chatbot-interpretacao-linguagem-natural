<p class="header1">General Astronomy Questions</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="astrology"></a></p>
<span class="header2">What is the  difference between astronomy and astrology?</span><br>
<p>Believe it or not, this is the most asked question that  astronomers encounter. Many people do not understand the difference. In  ancient times, they were considered one and the same. But the two disciplines were separated during the Age of Reason in the 17th century. Astrology is a practice of using the locations of the planets to look into a person's personality or predict the future. It is not a science and is considered a  form of divination. By contrast, astronomy is the scientific study of the universe. Astronomers observe the objects in the night sky to try to determine their composition and learn more about the origin and structure of the universe.</p>
<p><a href="#general">Return</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="expensive"></a></p>
<span class="header2">Do I need an  expensive telescope to enjoy astronomy?</span><br>
<p>Many people hesitate to get involved with astronomy  because they believe it requires expensive equipment. The only thing you really need to enjoy the night sky is your eyes, a dark viewing location, and some patience. To get a better look at things, a pair of binoculars can  provide a really good view. Many people will be surprised how many more  stars and objects they can see with a decent pair of 10X binoculars. They collect much more light than the human eye and will bring much dimmer objects into view. You can even see Jupiterâs moons with binoculars. A simple camera tripod to steady the binoculars is also a good idea, since your arms can get  tired very quickly.</p>
<p><a href="#general">Return</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="telescope_work"></a></p>
<span class="header2">How does a  telescope work?</span><br>
<p>The primary purposes of a telescope are to gather light and  magnify an image. The aperture (opening) of a telescope is larger than that of the human eye and therefore, can gather much more light. This enables us to see dim objects that are too faint to see with the naked eye. The larger the aperture of the telescope, the more light it can gather. Telescopes also use a  series of lenses and/or mirrors to magnify the image, enabling us to see more detail.</p>
<p><a href="#general">Return</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="see_stars"></a></p>
<span class="header2">Why can't I see very many stars at night?</span><br>
<p>If you live near a big city, you may not be able to see a lot of stars. The reason for this is light pollution. Dust and water vapor in the atmosphere reflects the bright city lights back down towards the ground. This âlight pollutionâ tends to be brighter than some of the dim stars and other deep sky objects, essentially hiding them from view. To truly appreciate the night sky, you must get as far away from city lights as possible. There is no more beautiful sight then the band of the Milky Way stretching across a dark sky. We can all help to combat light pollution by convincing our local authorities to use more efficient light fixtures that shine the light on the ground and block it from going up into the sky.</p>
<p><a href="#general">Return</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="space_begin"></a></p>
<span class="header2">Where does  space begin?</span><br>
<p>Space is defined as the area above the Earthâs atmosphere. But there is no specific boundary since the atmosphere gradually thins out as you move farther away from the Earth. However, NASA awards astronaut status to anyone who flies above 50 miles (80 km).</p>
<p><a href="#general">Return</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="sky_blue"></a></p>
<span class="header2">Why is the  sky blue?</span><br>
<p>This is another question that gets asked a lot. The blue color of the sky during the day is caused by scattered sunlight. The white light from the Sun is composed of all the colors of the rainbow. During the day, the molecules in the air scatter the blue light from the Sun more that the red light making the sky appear blue. In the evening, however, we see the red and orange colors because the blue light has been scattered away from our line of sight.</p>
<p><a href="#general">Return</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="sky_dark"></a></p>
<span class="header2">Why is the  sky dark at night?</span><br>
<p>Believe it or not, there is no easy answer to this question. Scientists have observed that if the universe was infinitely large, and contained an infinite number of stars, then the night sky should actually be as bright and as hot as the surface of the Sun. But this obviously is not the case. This little brain teaser has come to be known as Olberâs paradox, named after the German astronomer who tried to solve the problem in 1823. The most likely explanation is that the universe is simply not old enough and the observable part of the universe contains too few stars to fill the sky with light. Thus, the night sky is dark.</p>
<p><a href="#general">Return</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="light_speed"></a></p>
<span class="header2">What is the  speed of light?</span><br>
<p>Light travels at a constant speed of 186,262 miles per second (299,792,458 meters per second). Since the speed of light is constant, it can also be used to measure vast distances. Distances between objects in space are measured in light years. One light year is equal to the distance light travels in a year, which is just under 6 trillion miles (10 trillion kilometers). The speed of light is considered to be the ultimate speed limit in the universe. Scientists believe that it is impossible to travel faster than light because any object traveling at the speed of light would have to achieve infinite mass.</p>

Several years later, Galileo became the first person to use a telescope for astronomical observation. With his early telescope, Galileo observed the craters on the moon, the rings of Saturn, and the moons of Jupiter.</p>

<span class="header2">How old is the Earth?</span><br>
<p>All though the exact age of the Earth is difficult to determine, scientists believe it to be about 4.54 billion years old. This age has been estimated by measuring the amount of radioactive decay in rocks and minerals on Earth, and by observing the elements that exist in the Sun. The age of the Earth is believed to be the same as the age of the Sun and the other planets in the Solar System since they all formed at the same time from the same raw materials.</p>

<span class="header2">How big is the Earth?</span><br>
<p>The mean diameter of the Earth is 7,918 miles (12,742 kilometers). Believe it or not, the Earth is not a perfect sphere. The rotation of the planet causes it to bulge slightly at the equator. The diameter at the equator is 7,926 miles (12,756 kilometers), while the diameter at the poles is only 7,900 miles (12,720 kilometers). Likewise, the circumference of the Earth at the equator is 24,902 miles (40,075 kilometers) while the circumference at the poles is only 24,860 miles (40,008 kilometers). Because the Earth is flatter at the poles and wider at the equator it is actually considered to be an oblate spheroid instead of a perfect sphere. However, if the planet were to stop spinning on its axis, gravity would pull it into a nearly perfect sphere.</p>

<p><a name="earth_composition"></a></p>
<span class="header2">What is the Earth made of?</span><br>
<p>The Earth is actually layered much like the layers of an onion. The outer layer is called the crust. The crust is composed mainly of iron, oxygen, silicon, magnesium, sulfur, and nickel with trace amounts of other elements. The next layer down is the mantle, composed mainly of magnesium and iron. The inner-most layer is called the core, which is composed of two parts. The outer core is believed to be a liquid iron and nickel alloy while the inner core is a solid mass of iron. The inner core is thought to spin within the liquid outer core, creating a magnetic field that protects the Earth from solar radiation.</p>

<span class="header2">How much does the Earth weigh?</span><br>
<p>The Earth is actually weightless because it exists in space. But it does have mass. If we were able to weigh the Earth in its own gravitational field, it would weigh approximately 13.2 septillion pounds. That is 13,200,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 pounds (6,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 kilograms). This number assumes we are weighing the planet in Earth's gravitational field. It would weigh more or less on other planets, depending on their mass. But wait, there more. The Earth is actually gaining mass. It is believed that our planet is  gaining about 40,000 metric tons of mass each year from space debris that impacts the surface and burns up in the atmosphere.</p>

<p><a name="earth_rotate"></a></p>
<span class="header2">Why How fast does the Earth rotate?</span><br>
<p>The Earth rotates once on its axis each day. Because it is so large, it is moving incredibly fast. Its speed, however, depends on the location you are measuring. At the equator, the speed is 1,038 miles per hour (1,670 kilometers per hour). The speed decreases as you travel further north or south. The middle latitudes of the United States and Europe are moving at between 700 and 900 miles per hour (1,125 to 1,450 kph). At the the poles, it is hardly moving at all. At the south pole, you would take an entire day just to rotate once in place.</p>

<p><a name="earth_orbit"></a></p>
<span class="header2">How fast does the Earth move around the Sun?</span><br>
<p>The Earth takes one year (365 days) to orbit the Sun. Since it is 93 million miles away from the Sun, it has to be moving extremely fast to cover this vast distance. As it orbits the Sun, the Earth moves at an average of about  67,000 miles per hour (107,300 kilometers per hour). This is only an average because the Earth's orbit around the Sun is not perfectly circular. It is actually slightly elliptical. When the Earth is closer to the Sun, it moves a little bit faster. When it is further away, it moves a little slower.</p>

<span class="header2">What is the terminator?</span><br>
<p>As the Sun shines on the surface of the Earth, it illuminates one half of the Earth's surface. The other half is in darkness, or night. The dividing line between day and night is known as the terminator. The terminator line passes through any given point on Earth two times a day, once during sunrise and again during sunset. Because of the tilt of the Earth's axis, the polar regions are an exception. They spend parts of the year in perpetual day and night. The terminator is not a sharp line on Earth. It is actually kind of blurry because the atmosphere scatters the sunlight. This is why we have dawn and dusk before sunrise and sunset.</p>

<span class="header2">How fast does the terminator move?</span><br>
<p>The terminator line moves across the surface of the Earth as the Earth rotates on its axis. Therefore, the speed that the terminator moves is the same as the speed that the Earth rotates. At the equator, the speed would be 1,038 miles per hour (1,670 kilometers per hour). The speed decreases as you travel further north or south.</p>

<span class="header2">Is the Moon  moving away from the Earth?</span><br>
<p>Yes, the Moon is gradually moving away from the Earth at  the rate of about 1.5 inches (3.8 centimeters) per year. We know this because we can track the Moonâs distance using lasers. The Apollo moon missions left reflective mirrors on the Moonâs surface. By measuring the time it takes a laser beam to travel to the Moon and back, we can calculate the distance using  the speed of light. When the Moon first formed, it was much closer to the Earth. Astronomers believe it was about 12 times closer than it is now, which  means it would have been much larger in the night sky.</p>
<p><a href="#moon">Return</a></p>

<p><a name="moon_formed"></a></p>
<span class="header2">How was the  Moon formed?</span><br>
<p>Astronomers believe that the Moon was formed billions of years ago when a small planet the size of Mars collided with the Earth. The foreign planet hit with a glancing blow and ejected a large part of the Earthâs molten mantle into space. Over time, this material coalesced and cooled to form  the Moon.</p>

<span class="header2">Why is the Moon larger when it is close to the horizon?</span><br>
<p>Although the Moon  looks much larger when it is low in the sky near the horizon, this is actually just an optical illusion. It is actually the same size as when it is directly over head. This illusion has been known since ancient times and also happens with the Sun and the constellations. This same illusion works on mountains and tall buildings as well. They appear larger at long distances than they do at closer distances. The reasons for this are complex, but they have something to do with how our brains interpret the sizes of large objects on the horizon. If you don't believe  this is only an illusion, you can compare the size of the Moon near the horizon to the size directly over head by holding your finger out at arm's length and comparing the sizes of the Moon with your finger.</p>

<p><a name="moon_phases"></a></p>
<span class="header2">What causes  the phases of the Moon?</span><br>
<p>The Moon goes through phases because it is traveling  around the Earth. One half of the Moon is always illuminated by the Sun. As the  Moon circles the Earth, different amounts of the illuminated part of the Moon  are facing us. These phases range from Full Moon (when the Moon is on the  opposite side of the Earth then the Sun) to a New Moon (when the Moon is  between the Sun and the Earth. It takes about 29 and a half days for a complete  cycle, which equals one complete orbit of the Moon around the Earth.</p>

<span class="header2">Can you see  the flag on the Moon with a telescope?</span><br>
<p>This is a question that astronomers get asked a lot. Unfortunately, the equipment left behind by the Apollo missions is tiny in comparison to the size of the Moon. Ground-based telescopes, especially those owned by amateur observers, are not capable of resolving  objects this small at such extreme distances. Extremely large telescopes could  theoretically catch a bright spot of sunlight reflecting from some of the moon  landing equipment, although they would not be able to observe the equipment directly.</p>
<p><a href="#moon">Return</a></p>

<p><a name="moon_blue"></a></p>
<span class="header2">What is a blue moon?</span><br>
<p>The answer to this question is a bit complicated. The most recent and most popular definition says that a blue moon is the second of two full moons occurring in the same month. Since the lunar cycle is 29 days and most months have 30-31 days, we eventually find a situation where a full moon occurs at the beginning and the ending of the same month. There is also a second, older definition of a blue moon. This one defines a blue moon as the third full moon in a season with four full moons. Normally there is one full moon each month, so a season such as summer would usually have three full moons. The reason for this is complex, and has to do with the ancient Christian ecclesiastical calendar. This calendar was used to determine important dates such as Easter. Each of the usual 12 full moons of the year had a name associated with the time of year in which they usually occurred. In a year with 13 full moons, the extra full moon was referred to as a blue moon so the calendar could stay on track.</p>

This constant stream of particles can interact with planets by slowly blowing away their atmospheres. The Earth has a strong magnetic field that deflects the solar wind around the planet and protects our atmosphere. Sometimes the particles from the solar wind can interact with gases in the upper atmosphere of the Earth, causing them to glow. This phenomenon is known as the aurora borealis (northern lights) in the northern hemisphere and the aurora australis in the southern hemisphere.</p>

This debris is usually no larger than a grain of sand. As the debris enters the Earthâs atmosphere at a high rate of speed, the friction causes the gases to glow. This glowing trail of ionized gas is known as an ionization trail. Meteor showers occur at the same time every year as the Earth passes through the debris field. Meteor showers can be stronger if the comet has recently passed by leaving a fresh stream of debris.</p>

Most of the asteroids in our Solar System are located between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter in an area known as the asteroid belt. They are thought to be the left over remains of a planet that was either destroyed or never fully formed. Asteroids can range in size from a few feet to several miles in diameter. Occasionally, gravity can cause an asteroid to change its orbit and send it on a path towards the inner Solar System. If the asteroid crosses the orbit of Earth, it is known as a near-Earth asteroid, or NEA. NEAs have a small chance of eventually colliding with the Earth. Meteor crater in Arizona is an impact crater nearly a mile across that was caused by an asteroid about the size of a city bus.

It is believed that most comets originate in an area at the outer edge of the Solar System known as the Oort cloud. Occasionally, gravity will disturb a cometâs orbit and send it on a new course toward the inner Solar System. Comets with highly elliptical orbits like this are known as periodic comets, and they return to the inner Solar System at a regular period.

<p><a name="comet_tails"></a></p>
<span class="header2">Why do comets have tails?</span><br>
<p>Comets are probably best known for their long, luminous tails. These tails are actually plumes of dust and gas that are ejected from the comet as it nears the Sun. Comets are composed of frozen ice and dust. If a cometâs orbit takes it close to the Sun, the solar radiation will cause the volatile materials in the comet to vaporize, carrying some of the dust along with them. As the Sun shines on this vaporized  material, known as the coma, it begins to glow. The solar wind pushes the material out away from the comet. Because of this, a cometâs tail always points away from the Sun. Comets will usually have two tails, one formed from ionized gas, and the other formed from dust reflecting the sunlight.</p>

<span class="header2">How long do stars live?</span><br>
<p>The life cycles of stars differ greatly and depend mostly on the starâs size. Large stars burn their fuel faster while smaller stars burn it more slowly. The largest stars burn their fuel so fast that they only last for a few million years. Average sized stars like the Sun live for about 10 billion years. Smaller stars, such as red dwarfs, burn their fuel so slowly that they can live for trillions of years. Our Sun is believed to be about 4.5 billion years old.

<p><a name="stars_die"></a></p>
<span class="header2">How do stars die?</span><br>
<p>Just as the lives of stars depends on their size, so does their death. Stars exist in a state of equilibrium because the gravity pulling in on them equals the pressure pushing out. When a star begins to run out of fuel, the outward pressure decreases, and gravity wins. The effect of gravity on the star depends on its size. Smaller stars will eventually lose their outer layers and shrink their cores to form white dwarfs. Larger, more massive stars will experience much more violent deaths. Gravity crushes these stars so fast that a shock wave is created, resulting in a massive explosion known as a supernova. What remains behind depends on the mass of the star. Large stars will form extremely dense objects known as neutron stars. The largest and most massive stars will experience such a tremendous crush of gravity that they will literally be crushed out of existence into what are known as black holes.</p>

<p>No. Most of the stars in a constellation have no connection with one another. They are simply chance alignments of the stars. The stars are all different distances from us, but because they are so far they all appear flat as seen from Earth. If you could travel far out into space, the constellations would look completely different from your point of view.</p>

<span class="header2">Are the constellations permanent?</span><br>
<p>All of the stars in the sky are moving in relation to the Earth. Since they are so far away, it takes thousands of years to notice their movement. But eventually the movement of the stars will make todayâs constellations completely unrecognizable.</p>

<p class="header1">The Universe</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="universe_old"></a></p>
<span class="header2">How old is  the universe?</span><br>
<p>This is a question that has puzzled astronomers for many years. The most recent estimates put the age of the universe at between 13 and 20 billion years. However, as new discoveries are made with the Hubble space telescope and other new technologies, these numbers may continue to be revised.</p>

<p><a name="universe_big"></a></p>
<span class="header2">How big is  the universe?</span><br>
<p>The latest estimates say it is about 156 billion light years across. Since one light year equals about 6 trillion miles, that is a very big number. But since we can only see so far,Â we may never know exactly how big the universe is. Some astronomers even believe the universe is infinite in size. And there  may be even other universes out there beyond ours.</p>
<p><a href="#universe">Return</a></p>

<p><a name="universe_begin"></a></p>
<span class="header2">How did the universe begin?</span><br>
<p>The most widely accepted scientific theory today suggests that the universe began about 14 billion years ago from an infinitely small, dense, and hot state that expanded rapidly. As it continued to expand and cool, hydrogen gas formed into stars and eventually formed into galaxies. This theory is known as the big bang theory and helps to explain why the universe appears to be expanding today. Astronomers have observed that galaxies are moving away from each other. The farther away a galaxy is, the faster it is moving away. The big bang theory states that it is actually the fabric of space that is expanding. Matter is simply going along for the ride like dust on the surface of a balloon. As the balloon expands, the dust gets farther and farther apart.</p>
<p><a href="#universe">Return</a></p>

<p><a name="universe_end"></a></p>
<span class="header2">How will the universe end?</span><br>
<p>Scientists used to think that the combined gravity from all of the matter in the universe would eventually slow its expansion and cause it to contract back into an infinitely small, dense state as it existed before the big bang. But now, most agree that there is not enough matter in the universe to slow its expansion. This means that it will continue to expand until all of the stars eventually burn out. Eventually, matter will decompose and all that will be left is a cold, dark void. That may sound depressing, but it will take at least 100 trillion years.</p>

<p><a name="many_galaxies"></a></p>
<span class="header2">How many galaxies are there in the universe?</span><br>
<p>This is a question that continually puzzles astronomers and is subject to frequent revision. The reason for this is because we can only see so far with the instruments we have available to us today. The most recent estimates by astronomers suggest that there are about 200 billion galaxies in the known universe. However, as new telescopes and new technologies emerge, this number is almost sure to be increased as we gain a better understanding into the true size of the universe.</p>
